In this post I will show you couple of gif examples of ggplot graph development which recorded by [camcorder package](https://github.com/thebioengineer/camcorder).

As mentioend in their documentation `camcorder` is an R package to track and automatically save graphics generated with `ggplot2` that are created across one or multiple sessions with the eventual goal of creating a GIF showing all the plots saved *sequentially* during the design process.

After installation, the package enables you to: 1. save a ggplot automatically every time you run ggplot() in any format with given specifications 2. generate a GIF that showcases every step of the design process using those image files 3. inspect the ggplot output directly with your specifications in the RStudio IDE-**youâ€™ll get what you see**

I particularly love the third point since it enables you to see the end result instantly instead of saving it with `ggsave`, for instance.

Here are some graphs:

And these are some recorded gif examples:
